                        ensure we show you advertising that is relevant to you, if you continue without changing your

                    <h5>COOKIE POLICY (GLOBAL)</h5>
                    <p>We and our affiliates, 3rd-parties, and other partners use cookies and other identification
                        technologies on our websites, mobile applications, email communications, advertisements, and other
                        online services (collectively, the ‘Services’) for a number of purposes, including: authenticating
                        users, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering
                        and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analysing site traffic and trends, and
                        generally understanding the online behaviours and interests of people who interact with our
                        Services. You can read more here about the types of cookies we use, why we use them, and how you can
                        exercise your choices.</p>

                    <h5>Cookies and Related Technologies Overview</h5>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online
                        media, and advertisements that are used to remember your browser or device during and across website
                        visits. We also utilise other technologies that may identify you or the devices you use. For
                        example, ‘pixel tags’ (also called beacons) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a
                        webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser,
                        including, for example: device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited,
                        time of visit, referring website, IP address, advertising identifiers, and other similar
                        information, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels
                        provide the means by which third-parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do
                        not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the
                        permission of the domain owner. ‘Local storage’ refers generally to other places on a browser or
                        device where information can be stored by websites, ads, or third-parties (such as HTML5 local
                        storage and browser cache). ‘Software Development Kits’ (also called SDKs) function like pixels and
                        cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The
                        primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, and thereby
                        allow the partner to collect certain information about user interaction with the app and information
                        about the user device and network information.</p>

                    <h5>Advertising Synchronisation & Relevancy</h5>
                    <p>In order to facilitate the most relevant ads possible, FoodGrubber works with various service
                        providers who assist us in delivering similar ads to end users across devices and platforms. For
                        example, we work with social media advertising services to provide you with relevant ads based on
                        your FoodGrubber activity through their media channels. We may also use service providers to provide
                        you with a similar ad on a mobile website or mobile application as with a traditional website ad.
                        See below for more information on your choices to limit these types of advertising.</p>

                    <h5>Your Choices</h5>
                    <p>You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, they are an important part of
                        how our Services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove cookies, this

                        by your browser which are usually located within the ‘Help’ or ‘Preferences’ menu. Some
                        third-parties also provide the ability to refuse their cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out
                        link, and we have indicated where this is possible in the table below.
